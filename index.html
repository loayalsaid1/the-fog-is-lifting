                    Islam in Women is a documentary examining the phenomena surrounding the fact that a majority of new converts to Islam are women, regardless of the fact that
                    most of the Islamophobic attacks on Islam decry that it is discriminatory and oppressive toward women.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the candid and inspirational interviews of 12 female converts to Islam, including a non-Muslim woman, a professor from Al-Azhar University, and a professor
                    at Harvard Divinity School, Islam in Women reveals the secrets behind why the religion attracts more women than men, in addition to refuting many of the misconceptions 
                    about women in Islam.Representing a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds, the women interviewed hail from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, 
                    Netherlands, Sri Lanka, Sweden and the United States of America.
                    <!-- <br><br>
                    Islam in Women was filmed on location according to interviewee residency, as well as in Tunisia at the 2012 annual Native European Muslim Association (NEMA) Camp and 
                    at Harvard University, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States.
                    The documentary has been subtitled in 10 different languages to date, including Arabic, Czech, Dutch, Filipino, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and Turkish.

                        Muslim civilisation there were amazing advances and inventions that still influence our everyday lives.
                        <br>

                        People living in the Muslim world saw what the Egyptians, Chinese, Indians, Greek and Romans had discovered and spent 
                        the next one thousand years adding new developments and ideas. Inventors created marvels like the elephant water clock, 
                        explorers drew detailed maps of the world, women made scientific breakthroughs and founded universities, architects 
                        built huge domes larger than anywhere else on earth. astronomers mapped the stars and so mucn more! This book takes

                    While the Quran is not a scientific textbook, it contains remarkable insights and arguments that extend beyond the realm of science. 
                    Even though the Quran has been proven in many aspects and arguments unrelated to science, it also presents scientific miracles and 
                    interesting facts.

                    <br>
                    It's worth noting that some people tend to exaggerate what they perceive as 'scientific miracles' within the Quran. However, 
                    there are undeniably fascinating facts and observations to be found.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One intriguing point to consider is how an individual, who was illiterate and lived in the desert over a thousand and four 
                    hundred years ago, could mention concepts and phenomena that were only discovered by modern science in the last century. 
                    This raises questions about whether there was a profound connection between the author (Muhammad) and the Creator, as 
                    described in the Quran.

                The story of Hayran Ibn al-Ad'af is the story of a young man whose passion in philosophy led him to search for answers 
                to his doubts and perplexity of the creator of the universe, Allah, may he be exalted. and starts his journey <b>after being <span style="color : rgb(253, 155, 64)">expelled</span> from his school
                for his passion about philosophy</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This book by sheikh Nadim al-Jisr, the Mufti of Tripoli and Northern Lebanon, is the summary of the journey of Hayran 
                    Ibn al-Ad'af who entrusted him with his notebook of which its composition is that of a story of the discussions and 
                    the courses dictated which are in truth only answers of the Shiekh Abu An-Nur al-Mawzun, one of the important scholars 
                    of Samarqand to the questions of young Hayran.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this book, the Sheikh al-Mawzun did not narrow his answers and explications to a simple statement of philosophical 
                    opinions, but he intervened to explain, direct, comment and criticize the thoughts of Greek, Muslim and the West 
                    philosophers and he also stated what is evoked in the Qur'an to reach faith and certainty.

                <p>
                    <h5>
                        Bridges’ translation was done with the aim of helping the non-Arabic reader in pondering the Qur’an (tadabbor).
                        The translators focused not only on translating what God meant to say but also on translating<strong style="color : rgb(253, 155, 64) "> how He spoke.</strong>
                    </h5>
                </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><h5>It is the first translation which includes the ten Qira’at (modes of recitation). The main text is written in accordance with the most commonly used Qira’a: that of Asem, narrated by Hafs. Variations from that are represented in footnotes. The translation presents around 30% of the variations of the Qira’at—those which affect the meaning and can therefore be demonstrated in translation. The rest are merely dialectical and cannot therefore be demonstrated in English. Terms that have footnotes related to the Qira’at’ are written in the text in red, and the related footnotes can be enabled or disabled from the settings.</h5></li>
                        <li><h5>It is the first translation that takes into consideration the Qur’anic phenomenon of grammatical shifts, whether in verb tenses, numbers, or pronouns. These are a great source of pondering for the reader. Speaking about the Hereafter in the past tense is a frequent feature of the Qur’an and this has been respected in this translation.</h5></li>
                        <li><h5>To denote whether a pronoun like “you” or an imperative verb like “say” is plural, dual or singular, the translators did not impose their understanding on the reader by adding text between brackets like (O Prophet) to denote singular form, or (O mankind) to denote plural form. Rather, this distinction was achieved by adding a superscript after nouns, pronouns and imperative verbs. For example: youpl is used for a plural pronoun, yousg for a singular pronoun and youdl for a dual pronoun. Likewise, imperative verbs such as “say” are expressed as saypl for a plural verb, saysg for a singular verb and saydl for a dual verb. It must be noted that in the Qur’an most imperative verbs in the singular form are meant to address Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).</h5></li>

                Talking to you from the past, the day i created this page,
                <br>back then i had no any experience or knowledge about web development, 
                <br> with the first version, plus i was in a hurry, it was just an idea with some basic knowledge about HTML and CSS
                <br>so, it's normal to see bad code with bad design and hard to maintain with no much commits on Github
