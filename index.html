                    Islam in Women is a documentary examining the phenomena surrounding the fact that a majority of new converts to Islam are women, regardless of the fact that most of the Islamophobic attacks on Islam decry that it is discriminatory and oppressive toward women.
                    <br><br>
                    Through the candid and inspirational interviews of 12 female converts to Islam, including a non-Muslim woman, a professor from Al-Azhar University, and a professor at Harvard Divinity School, Islam in Women reveals the secrets behind why the religion attracts more women than men, in addition to refuting many of the misconceptions about women in Islam.
                    Representing a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds, the women interviewed hail from Belgium, Britain, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Netherlands, Sri Lanka, Sweden and the United States of America.
                    <!-- <br><br>
                    Islam in Women was filmed on location according to interviewee residency, as well as in Tunisia at the 2012 annual Native European Muslim Association (NEMA) Camp and at Harvard University, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the United States.
                    The documentary has been subtitled in 10 different languages to date, including Arabic, Czech, Dutch, Filipino, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and Turkish. Bridges Foundation is actively seeking to provide subtitles in additional languages. Click <a href="https://bridges-foundation.org/contact-us/">here</a> to learn more.
